 #Tooltips
 tur_conquest_of_mam: "The @MAM Mamluks will collapse and all of their land will be ours."
 tur_conquest_of_hun: "The @HUN Kingdom of Hungary will collapse and our raids into the Europe will begin."
 tur_conquest_of_hun_2: "We will annex all Hungarian lands all the way to Balton Lake and Pest, roughly recreating historical borders where possible. The spoils of war will be brought home. The remaining husk of Hungary will be left to shatter and their central government will collapse."
 tur_collapse_hun_1: "Remnants of our nation' powers will be consolidated and we will try to hold power in main Transdanubia area. We will give up the southern and eastern territories to focus all our remaining power on surviving and restoring basic power structure. Abandoned lands that had little use for us will be founding ground for many rump states and petty counties."
 tur_collapse_hun_2: "We will establish autonomous vassal regions in northeastern lands in attempt to keep control over collapsing territories. With the central rule collapsing and monarchy crisis, crown of Hungary will be offered to foreign rulers and pretenders to save the nation from falling to Turkish hands. If Austria exists, we will offer their ruler to become our new king, else we will offer the same to Poland, Commonwealth, Bohemia and if none exist, local Habsburg will be invited."
 tur_collapse_hun_3: "There is no help for this fallen nation. We will abandon the crown of Hungary now that it has collapsed. Country will be HRE-ified, splitting into many successor states and counties. In our last attempt of surviving Turkish menace, the newly broken confederation will ask Holy Roman Emperor for protection and states will join the HRE."
 tur_collapse_tra: "Every province in Banat and Transylvania areas will be given directly to our control."
